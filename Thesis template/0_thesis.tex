%-----------------------------  README  ------------------------------------------
% THESIS TEMPLATE FILE - compatible with University of Leeds guidelines, and designed
% for use when submitting an alternative format thesis / thesis by publication.
% Key point is that by using biber instead of bibtex, bibliographies for each publication
% can be created from a single .bib file.
%
% Instructions:
%   - Tested to work on Overleaf (as of July 2020)
%   - Otherwise to compile yourself:
%     pdflatex 0_thesis.tex
%     biber 0_thesis                                            % NOTE NO EXTENSION FOR BIBER!
%.    makeindex 0_thesis.nlo -s nomencl.ist -o 0_thsis.nls      %Only needed if using the nomencl package for nomenclature
%     pdflatex thesis.tex
%
% Installing / getting it to compile:
%    When used with TexLive on Ubuntu 18.04, some other packages and biber are needed:
%    e.g. in a terminal:
%     sudo apt install texlive-bibtex-extra                                            % Usually missing if breakcites.sty can't be found
%     sudo apt install biber                                                           % used instead of biblatex as it supports refsections (which allows a bibliography in each chapter from a single .bib file)

%    Others that may be needed:
%      sudo apt-get install texlive-fonts-extra
%
%     Errors from missing .sty files are usually to do with missing packages.
%
% Latexdiff:
%    Great for tracking changes.  A nice guide to what can be a tricky install is here:
%    http://www.deanbodenham.com/learn/troubleshooting-latexdiff.html


% History
%     M.C.   Garthwaite 30/09/2011
%     D.P.S. Bekaert 	23/02/2016  Adapt for thesis by publication
%     M.E. 	 Gaddes		13/03/2019	Adapt to handle references from a single .bib file
%     M.E.   Gaddes     05/06/2020  Create minimum working template
%.    S.M.   Greenwood  17/06/2020  Re-adapted for traditional thesis submission, tidied up preamble, and tested on Overleaf.

I'd like to thank Stackoverflow for contributing the majority of my code, and to Wikipedia for always explaining topics that university lectures never could. I'd also like to thank Wolframalpha for solving my equations and fo never telling anyone that I couldn't integrate $\sqrt{x}$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Abstract %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter*{Abstract}
\fancyhead[RE,LO]{Abstract}
\fancyhead[RO,LE]{\thepage}

There are currently some observations in this specific area of science, which are important because presumably somebody cares. Previous authors tried to explain them with some data/maths but I think they did so incompletely. Here I include more data/maths because it wasn't complicated enough already and I can't get a PhD if I don't. I perform some kind of experimental procedure and some kind of modelling technique that my supervisor told me to use to show that these observations can indeed be explained by something. My 4 years of work therefore demonstrates that previous authors were out by 1\%, within the range of uncertainty.
