Oh, one last thing I guess are references. You can cite papers with the (author, year) e.g. This effect is significant \citep{Davies2015}. or just the year e.g. The study of \citet{Mound2019RegionalVariations} found ...

I personally wrote this thesis in Overleaf and linked it to my mendeley account to directly import the bib file. I liked to just copy the paper title and paste into Mendeley's desktop app `Literature search', then drop that paper into my `Thesis' group. Sync on the app, then refresh the file on Overleaf and it's done. Do whatever works for you best.

A note on using Overleaf. They will only compile your document if it takes less than 1 minute (4 minutes for the pro account). Once you start including lots of figures, for a thesis, you will easily exceed the 1 minute limit. One trick is to use the includeonly command (just before the begin document command) to specify which files should actually be compiled (e.g. symbols and 3_chapter3), speeding up the compilation for a specific chapter you are interested in. Otherwise, you could start downloading the source files and compiling them locally but that's probably a faff. There's lots of information out there on using desktop apps with \LaTeX instead of Overleaf. I was lucky to have had a v1 Overleaf account, that when transferred to the new v2 account, kept the git integration that is now a paid feature. I could just git pull to my local drive then compile with the included Makefile (even make local changes and push those back to Overleaf later if I didn't have an internet connection at that moment). I did this just because I was used to the Overleaf editor and quite liked it but, as always, do whatever works best for you.

All the best with finishing your PhD. It will be long, hard, and uncomfortable at times (that's what she said?) and nobody finds it easy, you are not alone. It will feel like you've learnt more about your project in the 6 months of writing than you did in the preceding 3 years. Never worry about creating a perfect (or even decent for that matter) draft of your thesis, best to get chapters off to your supervisors for comments earlier rather than later. Even the version you submit will still need to have whatever changes the examiners suggest applied. I submitted yesterday and as I put together this template, I've already found a mistake. A thesis is never finished, just submitted.
